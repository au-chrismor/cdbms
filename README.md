# Source Code for "C Database Development"
# Book by Al Stevens

I found this book many years ago, and it was useful in gaining an introduction to database principles as well as some "serious" C programming.

The code is largely the same as published in the first edition with two minor changes:

* Make it more "ANSI-Like".
* Add support for the Compaq and HP VMS C Compilers.
